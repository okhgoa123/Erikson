            <p class="reflection">As I would continue my career in the computer science field I would like to make programs that help make a lasting impact. One particular way is through the environment, making apps or technologies that would make it easier to dispose of waste. Additionally, as I have served as clean-up club officer in high school I would hope some of the values I inherited while serving are instilled in my children, such as taking care of where we live. By passing these values on, it will make a lasting difference for the world.</p>
