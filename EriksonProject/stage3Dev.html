            <p class="reflection">By this time, I was looking forward to start trick or treating as I had seen my cousins and sister do so before. I chose my own costume to wear that night and was very happy that I was able to do some of the things I wanted. Additionally, I started exploring my home's massive yard a couple of times on my own whim, plucking out some flowers and plants I found interesting. Being able to have that freedom to start exploring was exciting for me, but at times I was anxious of the occasional scoldings, especially if I got dirty.</p>
