            <h2 id="reflectionHeader">Explanation</h2>
            <p class="reflection">Other than learning to walk and roam around, I usually wasn't given much opportunities to seek my own autonomy and lacked independence. Even though I could walk, I was usually carried around. My parents often did most things for me at this age, such as choosing clothes and my food. I stayed very close to my parents and didn't like to wander off. Overall, this caused me to doubt and question some of my own decisions later in life as I got older due to my lack of experience with autonomy.</p>
