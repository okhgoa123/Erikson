            <p class="info">Welcome to my Erikson's Project! There are two ways to navigate through my project:</p>
            <h3 class="modes">Developmental</h3>
            <p class="info">The developmental mode will take you from stage to stage. In order to represent development, the website will "evolve" or develop, starting out as a plain and basic page but gradually grows in structure and style with each new stage, eventually becoming a well-polished website.</p>
            <h3 class="modes">Timeline</h2>
            <p class="info">The timeline mode will lay out all the stages of Erikson's in a well-polished fashion without having to go through each stage individually. To see more details about each stage, click on the section.</p>
