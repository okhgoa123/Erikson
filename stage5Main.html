            <h2 id="reflectionHeader">Explanation</h2>
            <p class="reflection">As a violin player who started back in my early teenage years and continuing to play in the orchestra, I have explored and engaged with my artistic/creative identity through my musical ability. By also learning to code recently, I have also experienced a more practical and tech-oriented part of my identity. As I am currently in this stage, I am currently eaving diffusion and nearing identity achievement by choosing to follow the computer science route in college and later on in my career.</p>
